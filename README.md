  I am a consultant and freelancer from Austria focusing on Angular. With a strong passion for frontend architecture and performance, I help teams to build scalable and maintainable applications. As a content creator and trainer, I share my knowledge and experience with the community. More about me [here](https://ng-journal.com/about/).


I started [NG Journal](https://ng-journal.com) in 2022 with the goal of sharing advanced enterprise Angular knowledge and practices with the community. What started as a blog has become much more over time. Nowadays, NG Journal is not only a blog, rather it is a place where advanced enterprise Angular content is gathered. This knowledge is accessible through the [blog](https://ng-journal.com/blog/), my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stefan-haas/streams), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-haas-686a921b4/) for Angular tips or through my in-depth [Nx workshop](https://ng-journal.com/workshops/nx-scaling-angular-applications) for companies.
