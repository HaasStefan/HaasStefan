Hi 👋🏻, I'm Stefan. 

I am a senior software engineer at Microsoft. As a frontend platform engineer, I am either wrangling some AST transforms with the TypeScript compiler or some monorepo performance issues.

I have got a lot of experience with Angular, TypeScript, Nx and NodeJS. I am pretty comfortable in the whole JS-land and have a good understanding of how frameworks internally work and how tooling like bundlers, linters, formatters and compilers work.

I am currently learning a bit of Rust 🦀

If you are interested in Frontend Ops topics, I sometimes write a blog post [here](https://stefanhaas.dev/#blog).
