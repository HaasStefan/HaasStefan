I am a passionate web developer and freelancer from Austria. I am deep into Angular and its ecosystem but I am also intersted in all the other frontend frameworks. I have helped various companies, governments and startups in their web journey.

I enjoy improving developer experiences using Nx Monorepositories by speeding up local and CI builds, while creating architectural guardrails and automating developer workflows.
 

 I like Angular, Nx, TypeScript, RxJS, RxAngular, React, NestJS and Tailwind. So basically everything that ends with a `.JS` ðŸ˜‰
